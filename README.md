# RAGE: Making serious games with reusable software components

## Workshop info
The workshop is organized as part of the [Joint Conference on Serious Games 2018](http://www.jointconference-on-seriousgames.org/), November 7-8, 2018, Darmstadt, Germany. The conference program is [here](http://www.gamedays2018.de/index.php?id=1044&L=1).

The workshop will be held on the second day of the conference (November 8, 2018) from 10:45AM until 12:30PM.

## Organizers
The workshop is organized with the support of the [RAGE H2020 flagship project on (serious) game technologies](http://rageproject.eu/). The workshop will be led by:
* Wim van der Vegt (Wim.vanderVegt@ou.nl), Open University of the Netherlands
* Enkhbold Nyamsuren (Enkhbold.Nyamsuren@ou.nl), Open University of the Netherlands
* Wim Westera (Wim.Westera@ou.nl), Open University of the Netherlands

## Aim
The workshop entails a hands-on technical session addressing how to enrich your serious game with RAGE software components. Based on concrete examples discussed and presented in the workshop you will learn and understand how to quickly unpack, install and integrate software components in your game project.

## Target participants
The workshop is primarily targeting developers from game studios as well as researchers, educators and students involved or interested in game development. Given the technical scope of the workshop, participants should have some basic knowledge of software development and/or game engines. 

## Preparations
The workshop will consist of a short introductory presentation and a longer hands-on session involving some coding. For the presentation, you may want to check the [RAGE Portal](https://www.gamecomponents.eu), which is currently exposing up 40 ready-to-use game technology components. If you want to actively participate in the hands-on session then a laptop with Visual Studio is required.

## Rationale
The European Commission has designated (serious) gaming as a top priority for addressing a multitude of societal issues in, e.g., education, training, and health, and in the wider scope of the “digital transformation” of society. Today, however, the serious gaming landscape is still highly fragmented, exposing a lot or reinventing the wheel. Component-based approaches and the reuse of software will support developers at creating better games easier, faster, and more cost-effectively.
